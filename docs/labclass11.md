**Laboratory Class 11**

In this class, we will study differentiable rendering from a rasterization perspective.

**Our goals are to understand the following:**

- Why differentiable renderer is important.
- Which operations of the rendering pipeline are non-differentiable 
- Strategies to implement a differentiable renderer
